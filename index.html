    <section class="why">
        <h2>Why I Started This Blog</h2>
        <p>
            When I first started learning web development, I found that while there were countless resources, 
            few broke things down in a clear and practical way. I created this blog to be the kind of resource I wish I had—focused, 
            approachable, and packed with real-world examples. Whether you're a beginner just diving into HTML5,CSS and JavaScript or an 
            experienced developer looking to refine your skills, my goal is to provide you with the knowledge and tools to build 
            better websites.
